The Screen Shot above shows my example Employee "Tracking" Sheet, the python code is reading the boxes highlighted in yellow or the employee name, start time, end time, Phone number, and Phone Provider. this will allow flexibility when different employees are working first or second shift making changes easilly updated. 

The point of this project was to make a scripted that could run in the backround and not need to be updated or changed when different employees are working different shifts.

Note this is only set up to handle the first employee as a proof of method and can easily be scaled up.
